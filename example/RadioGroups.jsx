        RadioGroups allow the user to pick one option among many
        with a design similar to HTML's input type radio.

      <SecondaryTitle>Stateless</SecondaryTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Stateless RadioGroups shall be used when you will control
        it's selected value. Therefore, you're in charge of
        implementing the props <b>onChange</b> and <b>selected</b>.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        As a rule of thumb, you'll use the stateless component if
        the RadioGroup is not in a form, and you want to trigger
        something on every change of this component.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        An example implementation of how you should consume the
        RadioGroup is the UncontrolledRadioGroup itself.

        <RadioGroup selected={1} onChange={alert} data={data} />
      </Code>

      <SecondaryTitle>Statefull</SecondaryTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Use the statefull selector if you don't want to control
        the selector, or you're using it on a form, passing the
        prop <b>name</b>.
